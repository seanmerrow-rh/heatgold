# Introduction
At the risk of sounding like a prima donna parent of a prima donna pitcher, 
I've decided to put down some thoughts on fastpitch softball pitching. My
hope is that some other parent or coach may find this useful. Everything in
this article would apply to just about every pitcher, not just my daughter.
These thoughts are based on the following:

* Listening to her pitching coach as she coaches my daughter
* Listening to her team coaches as they coach her while pitching
* Listening to what my daughter has to say after time spent with her 
pitching coach or after a game

You can see the common theme here is listening.

There are many things that a parent and/or coach can do to help a pitcher. Not
all of them require that they know a lot about pitching. Note that the following
tips are assuming pitcher has received some specialized training and has
achieved some level of experience and may not apply to beginner pitchers
below 12U.

# The Warm-up
The warm-up is very important in avoiding injury as well as getting her dialed-in. 
Here are some tips on the warm-up.

* Make sure your pitcher has done some warm-up exercises and played 
overhand catch for a bit.
* Your pitcher has a warm-up routine. Let her go through it in full. If 
the warm up is rushed, then you're simply making the first several pitches 
of the game part of her warm-up. 
* The catcher, whether that be a parent, coach or team catcher should
let the pitcher go through her full warm-up routine at her own pace. She 
doesn't need to be told when to move to the next drill, when to practice 
different pitches, and when to stop. Of course the warm-up works both ways. 
If the catcher wants to work on something with the pitcher, she should 
communicate that so both are happy with the warm-up.
* If she won't be the starting pitcher, but will be pitching later in the
game, try to guage when she may go in, so you can warm her up just before
going in to pitch in the game (when possible). 

# The Game
Once the pitcher is in the game, its up to the coaches and players to give 
her all the support they can. Emotions are running high and people will be 
shouting from the field, the dugouts and the stands. The pitcher will probably 
be trying to block that all out, while still listening for comments from the 
coaches. Here are some tips on how to help, or not help, the pitcher.

## Helpful
We'll start off with the ways the pitcher can be helped during the game.

* Cheer her on. Be positive.
* Go out to the mound if she is struggling and give her some encouragement.
* Teach her catcher how to tell if she is struggling and let the catcher know
it is okay to call timeout and go to the mound. 
* If you see some obvious errors she's making, go to the mound and let her know
what she's doing wrong, rather than shouting it out in front of everyone.
* Give constructive feedback, that she can act on, if she's missing a lot:
    * If she's aiming, tell her to pitch full speed every pitch...be explosive
    * If she's leaning back, or bending forward, when throwing the pitch, tell 
    her to push out hard, stand tall, with weight forward
    * If her backswing is going behind her back or causing her shoulders to turn,
    tell her to straighten her arm circle and keep her shoulders squared off with 
    the catcher
    * If her drag foot is not following through, tell her it should reach her 
    front leg before the ball gets to the catcher
    * If she's falling to one side after her pitch, tell her to straighten out
    and land balanced

## Not Helpful
This mostly comes into play when the pitcher is struggling. Maybe she's not on
that day, maybe she hit a batter or two or maybe she just took a line drive right
back at her. If she's struggling, believe me, she's wants to fix it more than you 
want her to fix it. Here are some examples of things that are not helpful.

* Shouting to the pitcher "Fix it!". This is not constructive, implies that she 
needs to be told to fix it, and isn't advice she can act on. Trust me, she's 
trying to fix it.
* Shouting "Focus on the target/glove!". This was appropriate in 8U and 10U, but she's
not only focusing on the target, she's focusing the the 'spot' of the target. If
you really feel her focus on the target is a concern, check that she is actually 
getting a target and that the target is steady and not moving around.
* Shouting negative comments such as "You're killing me!", shaking your head, putting
your head in your hands, etc. This will only add to the stress she's dealing with and 
will likely only make matters worse.
